      <h1> Hi, this is my own page! Pretty cool, am I right?</h1>

      <p> This is the About Me page! </p> 

    <h1>My Introduction!</h1>
  Hello everyone! My name is Aiden Sandoval. I love reading literature of all kinds, 
    no matter how it's written. I sometimes fancy myself writing stories about things 
    on my mind. When I'm rather bored, I like playing video games of vastly different 
    genres. I also watch television on my downtime. When it comes to food, I'm a sucker 
    for it! When I'm a bit down on the ropes, I'll watch Ridiculousness, one of the 
    funniest shows I've ever seen. If you must know, my top 10 video games of all time
    is Sonic CD, Mario Super Sluggers, Kirby Super Star, Super Mario Galaxy 2, Donkey
    Kong Country 3, Gundam Wing: Endless Duel, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, International
    Superstar Soccer 64, Yume Nikki, and Papa's Scooperia.

  <h1>Soccer: My Dream Stadium!</h1>
  My favorite sport, without a doubt, is Soccer (or Football for those in other countries). 
    It's such a wonderful game, where people of all walks of life can unite and kick the ball s
    traight into the goal. As Pele, one of the greatest soccer players of all time said, it 
    is "The Beautiful Game". Soccer is like the wind: It moves everyone. My favorite soccer 
    team is the Yokohama F. Marinos. If you wanna know, my second favorite sport is Volleyball.
    I must say though, the anime Haikyuu!! isn't all that good depicting accurate volleyball.
    My LEAST favorite sport is probably football, because it's so physical and you have to have
    a lOT of stamina!
<p>
 <h1>The Conclusion!</h1>
  I'm a rather sensitive person who often feels with emotions and passion. I really hate all 
    forms of conflict, because I like to find a more rounded way of solving things. If there's a 
    pragmatic solution, then best believe I'll follow it! I really love aspects of nature, l
    ike animals and plants. My favorite animal is the seagull, because they are so free to be 
    themselves and move where they want to go. A person being their true self is what I really 
    appreciate deep down. It's one of those phyllisophical things ya know? I don't judge people on 
    things they were born with, because we all have something unique with ourselves that we should 
    share. With all of that being said though, I hope you enjoy my bio!
