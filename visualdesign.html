      <h1> Hi, this is the Visual Design page! Come see all of my unique designs!</h1>

      <p> The bottom will explain everything!</p> 

    <h1>Picture #1 </h1>
    <img src = "Asthetic Project.png" alt = "Group" width = "400" height = "400">
    <br>
    <p>I used Adobe Express for this project of mine, mainly using shapes and angles to capture the experience. 
      I included pictures of stuff that really affected me during my life, like video games and nature and sports 
      and literature. These were things that I absolutely loved as a kid, and even to this day I still adore these games. 
      I really think my collage matches my aesthetic because it’s my favorite colors and it’s bright and detailed. Overall, 
      I’m quite proud of my work.</p>
    
    <h1>Picture #2 </h1>
    <img src = "Stanley Stork.png" alt = "Stork" width = "300" height = "300">
    <br>
    <p>I started by outlining the overall shape of the character, as I personally feel like it’s easier than drawing the 
      character itself, THEN making the shape. My character is called Stanley Stork, a purple openbill stork with a long 
      orange beak and a post office uniform. He has simple brown fancy shoes. If they were in a video game, I would make 
      it like a mission-based game, where you play as Stanley delivering mail to people all over the world. The message 
      of the game would be to show diversity, and how unique and united our world is. There would be obstacles, but more 
      like weather and other rival delivery companies.
      
      <h1>Picture #3 </h1>
    <img src = "Pagularmingo.png" alt = "Pink Panther" width = "400" height = "400">
    <br>
    <p>I decided to choose 3 animals I love, which were the black panther, flamingo, and peacock. I chose the black 
      panther as a reference to the illustrious Pink Panther. To do this, I chose a flamingo since they are famous 
      for their pink color. Lastly, I chose a peacock because they’re an animal I actually like a lot because of 
      their tail. Overall, I wanted to make an animal that looks very stylish and regal. The kind of animal that 
      you would want to take a picture of!
      
      <h1>Picture #4 </h1>
    <img src = "Fire.png" alt = "Planet Burning" width = "500" height = "500">
    <br>
    <p>I chose the topic of global warming because I felt like it was a big issue that many people don’t 
      acknowledge. I found an image of a man sitting down in a depressive state, of which I layered the 
      image of an extremely polluted factory onto him. Then I put the background of a major forest fire 
      behind the man, with text saying that “arctic sea ice volume has declined by 80% since 1980”. I 
      made this intentionally depressing to show how long it’s been going on, and the tragic effects 
      that the world would go through if it continues. I just wanted to spread the word and hope people 
      would understand and feel sympathy for nature.
