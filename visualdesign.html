    <p> I used Adobe Express for this project of mine, mainly using shapes and angles to capture the experience. 
      I included pictures of stuff that really affected me during my life, like video games and nature and sports 
      and literature. These were things that I absolutely loved as a kid, and even to this day I still adore these games. 
      I really think my collage matches my aesthetic because it’s my favorite colors and it’s bright and detailed. Overall, 
      I’m quite proud of my work.
